### About
Fury is an experimental dependency manager and build tool for Scala. It is
still under active development, and is in private beta.

### Website
Full information about Fury is available on the [Fury website](https://fury.build/).

### Status
Fury is under active development, but is not publicly available yet. The code
will be open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 License in mid-November 2019, and an
experimental binary release will be made at the end of November 2018.

Until then, this repository will serve to track issues with Fury, and manage
the project.
